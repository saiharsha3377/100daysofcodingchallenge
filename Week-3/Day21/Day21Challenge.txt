Day 21 Assessment: Simple Contact Management System

I've just completed my Day21 Challenge - Week 3, which is wrapped with an engaging project where I enhanced s Simple Conctact Management System in JS.
Delved deeper into functions, arrays, and the ES6 class syntax, adding features to update and delete contacts dynamically. 
Thrilled by the power of code to bring ideas to life and solve real-world problems. 
Every line of code taught me something new and pushed my limits further.

Can't wait to tackle more complex challenges ahead! ðŸ¤©
