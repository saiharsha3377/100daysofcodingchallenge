Day 19 Challenge:

Assignment: Creating a Simple Bank System

Develop a simple banking system that utilizes encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction.

Requirements:

1.Create a BankAccount class with properties like accountNumber and balance. Include methods for deposit and withdraw.
2.Use encapsulation to protect the balance from direct access.
3.Create a SavingsAccount class that inherits from BankAccount and includes an interestRate property.
4.Implement polymorphism by overriding the withdraw method for the SavingsAccount to include a withdrawal limit.


let mySavings = new SavingsAccount('14325', 0.05);
mySavings.deposit(2000);
mySavings.withdraw(700); 
mySavings.withdraw (100);
