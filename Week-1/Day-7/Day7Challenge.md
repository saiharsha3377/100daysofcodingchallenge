# Day 7 Challenge: Collaborative Coding with Friends

## Day 7 Goal: Collaborate, Create Branches, and Raise Pull Requests

Welcome to Day 7 of the 100 Days Coding Challenge! Today, we'll dive into the collaborative aspect of coding. Let's team up with friends, create branches, and raise pull requests to learn how to work seamlessly together on coding projects.

### Your Goals for Today:

1. **Review Branches and Pull Requests (Refer to Day 5):**

   - If you haven't done so already, revisit Day 5 content to refresh your memory on creating branches and raising pull requests.

2. **Add a Friend as a Collaborator:**

   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - In the repository settings, navigate to the "Collaborators" section.
   - Add a friend as a collaborator by inviting them via their GitHub username or email.

3. **Collaborate with Your Friend:**

   - Coordinate with your friend to decide who creates the branch first.
   - Your friend creates a branch named `day7`, adds a folder named `day7`, and a file named `day7challenge.txt`.
   - Your friend raises a pull request to merge their `day7` branch into the `main` branch.

4. **Repeat the Process with Your Friend:**

   - Now, it's your turn. Create a branch named `day7`, add a folder named `day7`, and a file named `day7challenge.txt`.
   - Raise a pull request to merge your `day7` branch into the `main` branch.

5. **Review Pull Requests:**

   - Both you and your friend review each other's pull requests.
   - Make comments, suggest changes, and ensure the code is well-documented and clear.

6. **Merge Pull Requests:**
   - Once satisfied with the changes, merge the pull requests into the `main` branch.
   - Celebrate the successful collaboration!

### Story Time: The Symphony of Collaboration

Collaborative coding is like a symphony where each contributor plays a unique role, and together they create something harmonious.

### Assignment:

Share your collaborative coding journey! Post your thoughts or questions in the chat comments. Let's learn and grow together.
