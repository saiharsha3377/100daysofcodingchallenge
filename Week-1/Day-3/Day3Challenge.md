# Day 3 Challenge: Introduction to Git

## Day 3 Goal: Learn Git, Push Code to Github, and Sync with Local Machine

Welcome to Day 3 of the 100 Days Coding Challenge! Today, we'll delve into the fundamentals of Git and GitHub commands, making it easier for you to play with code and collaborate effectively.

### Your Goals for Today:

1. **Install Git:**

   - If you haven't installed Git, follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

4. **Add Folder and File on GitHub:**

   - On the GitHub web interface, navigate to your repository.
   - Click on "Add file" and create a new folder named `day3`.
   - Inside the `day3` folder, create a file named `day3challenge.txt` and add some content.
   - Commit the changes with a meaningful message.

5. **Pull Changes to Local Machine:**
   - In your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the cloned repository.
   - Run `git pull` to fetch and apply the changes from the GitHub repository to your local machine.

### Explanation of Git Commands:

- **Clone Command (`git clone`):**

  - Used to create a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.
  - Example: `git clone <repository_url>`.

- **Pull Command (`git pull`):**
  - Fetches changes from a remote repository and integrates them into the current branch.
  - Example: `git pull origin main`.
